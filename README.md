# Sierra Creative Interpreter - Tools (by sluicebox)

This repository contains my SCI reverse engineering software.

- Script decompiler
- Script annotators
- Resource parsers

This software generates my [SCI Scripts repository](https://github.com/sluicebox/sci-scripts), fuels my [blog](https://www.benshoof.org/blog/), and funds my [ScummVM work](https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/commits?author=sluicebox&path=engines/sci).

If you just want to decompile some games, then you can grab the results from [sci-scripts](https://github.com/sluicebox/sci-scripts). I ran the decompiler so you don't have to. But I didn't want to clutter up that collection with demos or fan games or network clients, so if you want to point this decompiler at the fringes, now you can.

If you're writing your own SCI tools or implementations, then you've come to the right place. The parsers are my readable references; they're heavily documented and handle all the versions I've found.

If you're doing your own SCI reverse engineering, then these are powerful tools, but it's hard to say how because I don't know what you're up to. I'll just say that you're a few short nested loops from having programmatic access to every resource in every game in your corpus, or every function in every script, or every bytecode instruction. If you're more interested in the decompiled scripts, then you can use the language parser to query them and add your own annotations.

If instead you want to play with matches while huffing computer science fumes off a non-trivial bytecode decompiler, then whatever search query got you here, well let's just say you nailed it. The decompiler is some of my best work, which is concerning, given that portions are certifiable. And I don't mean the kind that get you a genius grant, but the kind that get you decided on by courts. For example, if the control flow analysis doesn't make sense, try nodding off in the bath while staring at graphviz. If you're anything like me, it'll make perfect sense in the morning. Until you wake up. And don't get me started on the comments, they're so episodic and introspective that I had to register them as a blog. For tax purposes.

These tools are part of my cozy hobby. This repository is not where development takes place, but it is synchronized to stay up to date. I'm publishing this private work in the hopes that it's useful, but please understand that it's not an invitation. Though if I mucked something up, you can try to let me know. Unbridled praise night be fine too, I dunno. Have to try it on, see if it fits.

Thank you for reading the READ ME. If you didn't read it as Philomena Cunk then try again. But hahdur.
