// Workarounds: Skandal im Decompilirk!
//
// Prerequisite: Remove all debug instructions (file,line)
//
// There are a few specific functions in the wild that the decompiler is not
// capable of handling. They are detected here and their instructions are
// patched or flagged so that the rest of the process can happily proceed.
//
// Yes, this decompiler is hard-coded to certain functions. Skandal!
//
// There are so few workarounds that this summary is longer than the code,
// but I want to remind myself of the remaining categories:
//
// 1. Broken instructions due to compiler bugs or mistakes in hand-written
//    assembly. The accurate interpretation is to fail on these, just like they
//    fail at runtime, but I'd rather decompile them and annotate the code with
//    a comment explaining that the specific line will crash.
//
//    That said, Companion successfully decompiles the kq5-pc98 functions!
//    An impressive win for reverse instruction consumption. But I think it's
//    inaccurate to produce code that implies it works when it really doesn't.
//
// 2. One garbage instruction (possibly a compiler bug) breaks my switch
//    detection, and it's too late to rewrite it. It's one function in one
//    obscure PQ3 localization, and I didn't discover it until the very end of
//    the project. Too late, switch detection is hard and I'm not inventing a
//    new one. Sounds like a great way to fail to finish! Companion decompiles
//    this function and accurately emits the nonsense in the script.
//
// 3. For loops with continue statements are not handled by this decompiler!
//    Oof, that hurts. There are a few specific patterns that are detected and
//    handled, and some for/continues happen to decompile as other equivalent
//    control flow structures, but the decompiler does not generically detect
//    continue statements in for loops so it's likely to fail on most of them.
//
//    This was supposed to be my final boss, but when I got to the end, nobody
//    showed up. There were only two of these functions in all of SCI. TWO?!?!
//    "I think we're done here." A few minutes later I had my 100% decompiler.
//    (Long after the release, I added LSCI support and found a third function
//    in an INN script.)
//
//    I was looking forward to solving this! I'd been thinking about it and knew
//    it would be hard, but I figured once I had the graphs and could study all
//    their loops I'd eventually come up with something.
//
//    But I can't develop a difficult control flow algorithm, possibly the most
//    difficult, against a sample size of three. It would be a waste of time,
//    because I already know the answers. It also wouldn't work, because
//    anything can handle three cases, so it would effectively be untested and
//    likely incorrect. And it would probably be a ton of code! Maybe someday
//    I'll crack and generate a bunch of for/continue scripts, run them through
//    SC.EXE, and cosplay as a decompiler developer again. Until then, 100%.
