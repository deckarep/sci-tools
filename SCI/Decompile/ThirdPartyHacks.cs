// Third Party Compiler Compatibility Hacks
//
// My decompiler does not support third party compilers. And yet, here we are!
//
// It's been a year since I finished the decompiler, and I've mostly recovered.
// For fun, I took a look to see how close it was to handling Companion's code.
// Pretty close! In some ways, Companion's code is easier because it doesn't do
// Sierra's optimizations. This exposed an off-by-one bug in my loop deduction
// that would never have occurred with Sierra-optimized code. Then I took a look
// at SCI Studio and it has similar behavior as Companion, with just a few more
// bugs and quirks. So sure, fine, whatever, let's do them all!
//
// Every fan game I've found now decompiles 100%, except for hand-written assembly
// that can't be represented in script. (zork-demo has a few of these.)
//
// I can now round trip entire Sierra games through my decompiler, recompile them
// with Companion, decompile them 100%, and diff the results. This process has
// ruthlessly exposed bugs in my decompiler and Companion's compiler; I've
// since fixed two compiler bugs in The Cat's fork.
//
// Here are the third party compiler issues, some of which are handled elsewhere:
//
// 1. Branch targets differ from Sierra's
//
//    - BT => BNT will instead target the instruction after the BNT
//    - BNT => BT will instead target the instruction after the BT
//
//    Most third party functions that didn't decompile were due to this.
//
//    The overall control flow is the same, but Companion's branch code is
//    significantly different than Sierra's. It's not a compiler bug, but
//    it creates a different graph structure than what I was expecting.
//    This breaks my control flow analysis algorithm in several ways.
//    I also find these graphs harder to understand, because the branches
//    appear to escape their scope.
//
//    Both instruction patterns can be detected during preprocessing and
//    patched to target the previous instruction, as Sierra's compiler
//    would have done before applying its own optimizations.
//    That's all it takes to satisfy my CFA algorithm.
//
// 2. DoWhile Loops exist in SCI Studio Syntax. See below for details.
//    Short version: detect them during Loop Deduction, flag, patch,
//    then AstBuilder generates the equivalent repeat loop.
//    I also had to allow for bt as a latch instruction.
//
// 3. LINK instruction sometimes don't allocate enough space.
//    I now allow out-of-bounds temps and annotate the function
//    as having a compiler bug. Not sure which compiler did this,
//    if any; it may have been a mistake in a template's asm block.
//
// 4. Unused instructions ssgi/ssli/sspi/ssti are now used.
//    These are "unused" in that Sierra's compiler never emitted them,
//    so I threw an error on them. Now AstBuilder consumes them.
//    I fixed Companion's compiler to stop emitting these instructions,
//    as they break the language when consuming their expressions.
//
// 5. Arithmetic Assignment with Complex Variables.
//    A messy history here. Companion uses creative instruction
//    sequences for arithmetic assignment when the target is a complex
//    variable and the indexer isn't a constant. It emits pprev, and
//    used to emit toss too, both of which break decompiler assumptions.
//    The first sequence was completely broken and the second was
//    partially broken. I've fixed this in Companion, so now there are
//    three possible sequences. I detect them all in preprocessing,
//    delete them, and flag the arithmetic instruction so that AstBuilder
//    creates an arithmetic assignment node. SCI Tetris is the only
//    fan game I've seen with any of these sequences.
//
// 6. Companion optimizes away array indexes when the index is constant.
//    That doesn't break decompiling, it's just annoying because
//    it breaks array detection, so the results are less clear and
//    the variable types are wrong, so it also prevents matching
//    original source by function signature. This was removed in
//    The Cat's fork for better decompiles. Just noting it here.
//
// 7. SCI Studio creates weird switches when default/else isn't
//    the last case in the code. The default case always executes
//    when reached because the compiler doesn't place it as the
//    last case. This produces unexpected control flow. Companion
//    can't decompile these but its compiler fixes the bug by
//    always placing default/else last. My switch detection just
//    happened to already handle this: it produces a default/else case
//    containing the actual control flow.
//
// 8. SCI Studio breaks switches after 16 cases. Classic C program!
//    Betrayed Alliance has three of these, I've detected it in five
//    other games. Companion asm's these. SwitchDetection now handles
//    this; the rest of the switch is treated as the default/else case,
//    which is accurate control flow for this mess.
//
// 9. Undecompilable functions are allowed and exist in fan games.
//    zork-demo has functions with SCI Studio Syntax asm blocks
//    in the middle of the function to jmp out of a loop to an
//    arbitrary label.
//    Ash's QFG4 patch has undecompilable functions because Companion
//    asm'd those functions and he modified them by hand, but that
//    resulted in an invalid function call in one script, and a
//    switch with unrepresentable control flow in another.
//
// A. Sierra's compiler expands the text "\r" in a string literal as
//    a carriage return followed by a newline. Companion, and probably
//    Studio, just treat it as a carriage return.
//    I don't like the idea of emitting strings that different compilers
//    will interpret differently, so I write carriage returns as "\0d".
